# ðŸš€ Project Setup Instructions

To run the project in on Windows10/11 the following software is recommended
1. conda
2. vs-code

## Install conda (via. scoop) 
Conda is a virtual environment manager for python. Conda comes in two flavours Anaconda and miniconda3. I strongly recommend miniconda3 because it is fast to install, easy to use via the cmd and not bloated unlike Anaconda.

To install miniconda on Windows I recommend scoop, a command line installer for Windows, which is similar to apt on debian systems.
1. Install scoop by following the instructions on https://scoop.sh/
2. Install miniconda3 by copy pasting `scoop bucket add extras` into the command line and then `scoop install extras/miniconda3`
