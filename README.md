A Monto-Carlo Approach to classififation by using scattered data points

**To run the code on your machine follow the guide in [setup.md](setup.md)**

This notebook introduces a randomized classification method for scattered data points based on attribute guessing. The approach works as follows:

Random points are generated by randomly selecting attribute values within the input space.

Each randomly generated point is matched against the dataset to determine its class (e.g., by proximity or lookup).

This process continues until k valid hits (i.e., successful classifications) are collected.

The predicted class is then chosen based on the majority class among these k hits.

This method offers a simple way to explore the structure of the data and perform classification.
